%% Midterm Question 5
% Paul "Nick" Laurenzano

%% First Overview
% The block (0.2 units on each side) centered on the table shown below is
% rotated by 90 degrees about z2 and moved so that its center has
% coordinates [-0.3, 0.7, 0.1]’ relative to the frame o1x1y1z1.
% The camera is centered over the table and the front edge of the table is
% aligned with y0. 
%
% Compute the homogeneous transformation relating...

%% i) the block frame to the camera frame as a MATLAB HTM
% I did not have time for this problem because I got stuck on Problem 4.

%% ii)  the camera in the robot frame as a MATLAB HTM

%% Second Overview
% The camera measures the block position and orientation and sends it to the robot. 

%% iii) Compute the block frame in the robot frame (using i and ii) as a MATLAB HTM.

%% iv) Compute the joint parameters for the robot (from question 4) to pickup the block (center the end effector in the block). 

%% v)  What should the very first rotation be (instead of 90), if the robot end effector needs to be inserted into a hole in the center of the -x2 face of the block.  (the x2 axis should line up with link d3)
